# React Password Generator

## Project Overview
This project is a React-based Password Generator that allows users to create secure passwords with customizable constraints.

## Features
- Generate passwords of length ranging from 1 to 20 characters.
- Option to include numbers.
- Option to include special characters.
- Copy generated password to clipboard with a single click.

## Learning Objectives
This project was built to enhance understanding of React and its hooks. Key learnings include:
- Using the `useCallback` hook for optimization.
- Using the `useEffect` hook to run code on initial render and when dependencies change.
- Using the `useRef` hook to reference elements for DOM manipulation (actually used just to select the text in the input field).
- Implementation of basic `Tailwind CSS` for styling.
